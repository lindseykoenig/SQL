# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What is the average popularity, danceability, energy, and duration by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy), avg(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#2. Who are the top 10 artists by popularity?
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#3. List all of Doja Cat's songs ranked in Spotify's 2021 Top 50 songs. 
SELECT distinct artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name= 'Doja Cat'
ORDER BY track_name asc;

#4. List all songs and their artists that were above average in popularity?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity> (SELECT avg(popularity)FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);

#5. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN (SELECT track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10); 

#6. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, track_name as Song, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms=(SELECT MAX(duration_ms) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);

#7. Which 2 artists had the most songs on the 2021 Top 50 charts and how many songs did they have?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) as value_occurence
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY value_occurence desc
LIMIT 2;

#8. Which song key occured most often out of the 2021 Top 50 charts?
SELECT song_key, COUNT(song_key) as value_occurence
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY value_occurence desc
LIMIT 1;

#9. Here I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, showed their name, their average popularity, and labeled them as a â€œTop Star
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
